# Advent Of Code 2021

My implementation of aoc 2021 in Rust. I'm currently learning th languages so some of my solution are probably uneffective. 

## Usage

1. Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
2. Set the day you want to run in [main.rs](./src/main.rs)
3. Add your input in *src/inputs* as *dayX.txt* (where X is the number of the day)
4. Run the solution :
```sh
cargo run
```
